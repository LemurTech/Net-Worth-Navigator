# Active Context — Net Worth Navigator

**Iteration Window:** 2026-06-16 → 2026-06-17
**Current Status:** V1 complete and extended. Projection chart + tabbed Accounts/Cash Flow tables + Gantt timeline live. Raw TOML config editor is now available on the web.

## Current State

- `python run.py` — full run (live Monarch), deploys chart
- `python run.py --offline` — offline run (cached), fast re-render
- Chart: http://casalemuria.lan/finances/projection.html
- Accounts tab: trad IRA / Roth / taxable / cash / home equity / total net worth (yearly columns)
- Cash Flow tab: income / living expenses / event outflows / net (yearly columns)
- First-pass tax modeling is now active: job income remains net cash; Social Security and positive income events are taxed via effective pre/post-retirement rates
- Event-level taxability is now configurable in `config.toml` via optional `taxable` and `taxable_fraction` fields on `Income` and `SocialSecurity` events
- Withdrawal-source taxation and sequencing are now active: deficits withdraw from cash → taxable → trad IRA → Roth, with taxable/trad withdrawals feeding the simplified tax model
- Cash Flow tab now shows positive income events in Income and an `Estimated taxes` expense row
- Gantt tab: enabled-event timeline derived from `config.toml`, with milestone vs span semantics by event type
- Raw config editor is now available at `http://casalemuria.lan/finances/config/`
- Editor supports validate, save, and save+offline-rerender actions with timestamped backups under `output/config-backups/`
- Projection page now includes an `Edit Config` shortcut in the top toolbar
- The editor backend now runs as a small FastAPI app, proxied behind the static nginx container
- Gantt includes liability payoff milestones derived from the projection output and uses a centered legend
- Gantt row labels now include event/liability icons, and the Gantt includes a survivor-period band aligned to the projection output
- Both tables scroll horizontally, yearly tick columns
- First-column labels and section bands are frozen via JS `translateX(scrollLeft)` + `requestAnimationFrame`
- Table navigation now supports grab-and-drag panning and moderated wheel-to-horizontal scrolling
- Main chart now uses 2-year x-axis ticks with 6px tick-label standoff on both axes
- Page chrome, tables, and both Plotly charts now use a cohesive dark theme
- Main chart subtitle/label after `Net Worth Navigator —` is now configurable via `[display].projection_title` in `config.toml`

## Resuming This Project

Load the `personal-finance-modeling` skill — it contains all project
context, run commands, file structure, V1 inventory, and V2 candidates.
Then load `docs/activeContext.md` from the repo for current iteration state.

## Open Items for Next Session

- Confirm `survivor_annual = 66500` feels right (currently 70% of $95K)
- Confirm Person 2 SS estimate ($1,200/mo) once SSA.gov is available
- Decide next V2 priority: deeper tax realism vs withdrawal sequencing refinements
- Decide whether taxable brokerage withdrawal taxability should stay at 50% or be customized further
- Decide whether V2 should stay with raw TOML editing only or add structured form sections for simple config fields
- Surgery event amount is $18,000 in config — Person 1 confirmed this is correct

## Known Pitfalls

- Monarch auth expires periodically → re-auth: `cd /opt/monarch-mcp-server && uv run python login_setup.py`
- Plotly `add_vrect` annotation_text collides with vline labels — use separate `add_annotation` with `yref="paper"` instead
- `annotation_textangle=-90` + `annotation_position="top right"` is the correct vertical label approach
- `output/` is gitignored — do not commit generated HTML or cache
